# Rust PoC web server

This proof of concept uses [actix-web](https://actix.rs/) and [tokio\_postgres](https://docs.rs/tokio-postgres/latest/tokio_postgres/) to serve a simple HTTP REST API.
It is based off of [this](https://github.com/actix/examples/tree/master/databases/postgres) example.
The proof of concept is exploring what the Rust workflow feels like given a common developing task of writing and running a server backend, and to share the results with coworkers.
